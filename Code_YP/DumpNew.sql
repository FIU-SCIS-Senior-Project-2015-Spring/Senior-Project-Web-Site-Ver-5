Specifically, our framework will rely on a server-client architecture. Simple HTML+javascript clients will relay interaction events asynchronously to the server, the server will perform computation and rendering, and return updated renderings to the client as images.

This small OS is about 2k lines and most of the assembly code is done for the basics required to boot (and for initialization and architecture specific memory stuff) and is documented using doxygen making it easier to understand. This OS can also run very easily under emulation software like QEMU so you can try it without having to do much work other than compiling and running QEMU.\n\nThis project is pretty open in that you can add whatever feature you want to the OS as long as it is substantial enough to justify working on it for an extended period of time. This is a learning experience for those that might want to work in kernel programming in the future or just want to really strengthen their OS and low level programming fundamentals. I would encourage you to read through the source and possibly pull the source code and generate the documentation and look through it to see if this is the type of thing for you.

The project must use the LLVM compiler infrastructure[2] to allow compilation for different target platforms. So the project will create a compiler which translates this new language into LLVM byte code which then can use an LLVM code generator to generate the code for the target system. The front-end to generate the LLVM can be implemented in several different languages, which include C++, Python, and Ruby, so only one needs to be chosen.

A large data center may consume millions of gallons of cooling water each day; in addition, data centers also indirectly consume an enormous amount of water embedded in offsite electricity generation. As a result, water conservation is surfacing as a critical concern for data centers, amid the anticipation of surging water demand worldwide. Left unchecked, the growing water footprint of data centers can pose a severe threat to data center sustainability and may even handicap availability of services, especially for data centers in water-stressed areas. Existing mechanical solutions for conservation, such as using recycled/industry water and directly using outside cold air, are often costly and/or very limited by external factors such as locations, climate conditions, among others.

While the progress in data center energy efficiency is encouraging, the existing efforts have dominantly centered around owner-operated data centers (e.g., Microsoft). Another unique and integral segment of data center industry --- multi-tenant colocation data center, simply called “colocation”, which is the physical home to many Internet and cloud services --- has not been well investigated, which, if still left unchecked, would become a major hurdle for sustainable growth of the digital economy. In sharp contrast with owner-operated data centers where operators have full control over both computing resources and  facilities, colocation rents physical space to multiple tenants which individually control their own physical servers and power management, while the colocation operator is mainly responsible for facility support (e.g., providing reliable power and cooling). The uncoordinated power management, resulting from the colocation operator\'s lack of control over tenants’ servers, invalidates many of the existing power management solutions for owner-operated data centers, thereby making colocations’ operation highly inefficient. Thus, this project focuses on colocations and proposes to coordinate tenants’ power management via market approaches.\n \nIn this project, students will develop new power management modules based on a scaled-down prototype colocation system. These power management modules communicate with a control module via Internet and, upon receiving control signals, will dynamically adjust the servers’ power consumption through both software and hardware approaches (e.g., job scheduling, CPU scaling, power states).

The apparatus operates with a semiconductor/processor through an application where the purpose of use is determined specifically by the user. Within the pad are layers that include a see-through surface layer, an LED layer, touch & pressure sensors layer, an electronic layer, an electrical interconnect layer, and a robust supporting layer. These layers ensure that the illuminated pads stay durable for any related sports that it could be utilized in.  	\n	The general purpose of use is to drive athletic training by illuminating the pad or pads, requiring the user to either driving a ball to the illuminated pad or otherwise contacting the pad, and continuing the process as determined by the illumination sequence and timing. The sequence and timing would be determined by computer control and the activity chosen or created by user. The contact and pressure-sensor data would be recorded by the computer and would provide both immediate feedbacks with illumination and/or sound with varying intensity and data for analysis of the entire training session. The sequence of pad illumination creates a motion where user is forced to perform coordination with body and mind to compete in a time limited or free flowing environment. The design of the pad allows it to have a proper bounce back feeling to user as if he/she would kick a ball against a concrete wall or supported plywood. Once timed performance is complete the application allows the user to analyze the data he or she created for comparison. Pads have the ability to sense pressure which allows user to measure the power that is generated. The pads are portable and can be mounted on wall, ceiling or floor as user desires.\nPatent Pending.\n\n\nHi Massoud, \n\nSorry, its been busy at work the past few weeks.
